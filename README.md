# Tongue-twister

### About
This is a game to see how well you can put your tongue in a knot, recite your favorite movir or tell a killer joke. 
With a web speech API we created a speech-to-text function that matches what you said with random qoute from an API, or from an array of tongue twisters. 

#### Demo

The web speech function only works in chrome, keep that in mind.
